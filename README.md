# Site Explanation

This website was developed for a baseball and softball training center for a grad school project. The two pages feature:

* Responsive design for mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop.

* Cross-browser compatibility (full disclosure: the grids aren't working in Firefox. I spent too much time trying to troubleshoot, but I was too far along to risk compromising a structure that works in Safari and Chrome).

* Simple implementation of Sass mixins, variables, and nesting.

* Web animations with keyframes (fade on slider heading) and transitions (hover effect on buttons and nav).

*  Use of SVG (logo in header).

* Use of Flexbox (nav and 'Teams Training with Us' on About page).

* Use of grid layout ('Learn More' sections on Home page and 'Teams Training with Us' on About page).
